1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?
   A value or a function
   


2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?
   When you know the answer and don't need to do anything
   "interesting" like when it depends on the previous value



3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?
   When you need to do something more complex, like
   calculate the value based on the previous value
